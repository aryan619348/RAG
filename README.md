# RAG Chatbot

Welcome to the RAG Chatbot project! This chatbot utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide natural language interaction based on uploaded PDF and CSV files.

Built Using ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain OpenAI and FAISS

## Getting Started Locally

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/RAG-Chatbot.git
   cd RAG-Chatbot
2. Create a new Virtual Environment

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
5. Run the app:
   ```bash  
   python app.py


## How It Works
This chatbot integrates LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Users can upload their PDF and CSV files, then ask questions based on the provided documents. The chatbot retrieves relevant information from the uploaded files to generate context-aware responses.



## Future Improvements
1. Support for More File Types:
Enhance the chatbot to support a wider range of file types beyond PDF and CSV, such as Word documents, plain text files, and more. This will increase the versatility and usability of the application.
2. Add Chat Memory
3. Implement a chat memory feature that stores the conversation history. This would allow users to reference or continue the conversation seamlessly, providing a more interactive and context-aware user experience.
